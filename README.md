### Info
Use the [ability to receive an email to a Cloudflare Worker](https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/email-workers/) to analyze whether that email contains a voicemail attachment.
If it does, listen to it with [Whisper AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/whisper/) and send a summary to Telegram.

Note: your phone operator must give you the possibility to forward voicemail messages via email.
